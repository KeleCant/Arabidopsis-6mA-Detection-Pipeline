# Arabidopsis-6mA-Detection-Pipeline

# A note to the grader
This is a pipeline to reproduce our project. We know that you are aware of our situation. Our end goal for this project is to have a next flow in which you input a .bam file. Our steward/sponsor has not permitted us to share any of the data files outside of our Capstone group. For that reason we have included the nextflow file and a guide to what the pipeline does but without any data (as approved by Dr. Payne).

Inputs:
  These are the files we would provide you with
  ```
  1000.bam (~12.3 GB), 1000.bam.bai (~774 KB), arabidopsis.fasta (~115 MB), arabidopsis.fasta.fai (~195 bytes)
  ```
